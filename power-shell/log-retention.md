# Log Retention Script

This is a PowerShell script that searches for and deletes all ```*.log``` files in subdirectories of a given root directory:

Replace ```C:\Path\To\Root\Directory``` with the actual root directory path where you want to start the search for ```.log``` files. The script will go through all the subdirectories and delete any ```.log``` files it finds.

Please be cautious when running this script, as it will permanently delete all ```*.log``` files in the specified directories and their subdirectories. Make sure to back up any important log files before running the script.
