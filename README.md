# Shell - Jobs
*Very basic code instructions to work with legacy systems in a simple way..*

**Shell Scripts**
- Intended to show how start to work with automated and triggered taks on our system.
- This script runs in almost any UX system but it was tested on Debian/Ubuntu distros, stating at Ubuntu Linux 14.04 until Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS.

**DOS Batch Scripts**
- Scripts that can be executed on MS DOS, any Windows machine, using Command prompt or even PowerSell.

Regards.
